# Toronto Fire Incidents (2011-2019)

The purpose of this visualization is to inform the city planners and the fire department about details of fire incidents in the City of Toronto. More specifically, this visualization is designed to help city planners and the fire department to decide where additional fire stations should be built within the city, to reduce the number of fire incidents or minimize loss from such. The data that are used in the visualization is from The City of Toronto’s Open Data Portal. The datasets that we used included fire incidents data, fire station locations, and neighborhood profiles (Toronto Census 2016). There are two parts in the visualization: 1) a map on the left side and 3) a scatterplot on the right side. When the website is first opened, an info (information) box will pop up and hover over the scatterplot, in which highlights in the visualization will be stated, and readers can close it whenever so the scatterplot would be visible again. If the readers are interested in reading it again, the reader can click on a small button on the top right corner of the website to open the info box again.

Our main audiences are the city planners and the fire department in the city of Toronto, the map with a general overview and the map with specific details regarding neighborhoods would provide insights to the audience, so that they can see which neighborhood or which area within a specific neighborhood would require more fire stations. Also, with the scatterplot, our audience would be able to see if there is a trend between the number of incidents and time in each neighborhood, so that they can make a plan on the order of building fire stations. This means that they can first build more stations in more urgent neighborhoods, which are the neighborhoods with a strong positive trend on the scatterplot. Then they can follow the order (trend) and build in other neighborhoods. 

Our primary data source includes: 

- [Statistics Canada](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/rt-td/population-eng.cfm)
- [Open Data Toronto](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/)

## Development plan

Technology/Libraries to Be Used: In our development, we will be building a shiny app in R. The project will be deployed on Github as R projects for easy collaborations. The final product will be a shiny web app if time permits. The main libraries we will be using include "shiny" for creating interactive web applications; "tidyr", "dylpr", "lubridate" for data manipulations; "sf", “leaflet” and "opendatatoronto" for handling geographical data. Lastly, we will use "ggplot2" for plotting everything. 

## Installation

The interactive web app can be visit via [shiny.io](https://sijiexu.shinyapps.io/City_of_Toronto_fire_incidents_browser/) 

Alternatively, you could run the **fire incidents shiny app**  is pulling the [github repo](https://github.com/JackXu2333/STA313_Final_Project), or with command line: 

```
$ git clone https://github.com/JackXu2333/STA313_Final_Project.git
```

Hi there, it's the "Fancy Thoughts Squad", students from the University of Toronto teaming up for the STA313 final assignment. Hope anyone who read this will have a "fancy" day (?)... I guess?
